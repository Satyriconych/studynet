abstract - The abstract modifier indicates that the thing being modified has a missing or incomplete implementation. 
as - The as operator explicitly converts the result of an expression to a given reference or nullable value type. If the conversion isn't possible, the as operator returns null. Unlike a cast expression, the as operator never throws an exception.
